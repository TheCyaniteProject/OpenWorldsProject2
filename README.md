# OpenWorldsProject2 (OWP2)

OpenWorldsProject2 is an open-source RPG inspired by TES V: Skyrim, Stoneshard, and Dark Souls. The goal is to create a compelling, fun-to-play game that is Free and Open Source.

## Background

OWP2 is the successor to OWP. The original project was overly ambitious for an individual and constrained by certain tools, such as MapMagic. OWP2 addresses these issues without changing the end goal.

## Approach

- Framework: Built on [AnyRPG Core](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore) ([anymmo.org](https://www.anymmo.org/)), which provides a configurable RPG framework to drastically speed up development and improve quality.
- Terrain: Due to limitations with MapMagic and gain more control over world generation, we're building a custom Terrain Engine. It is also free and open source and can be found here: [OWP-Engine](https://github.com/TheCyaniteProject/OWP-Engine)
- Engine: Since we're starting over anyways, we're switching to Unity 6 for it's improved URP pipeline and new tools.

This is an extremely complex and ambitious project, but these changes should make it more manageable and elevate what I as a solo-developer can achieve.
