# OpenWorldsProject2 (OWP2)

OpenWorldsProject2 is an open-source RPG inspired by TES V: Skyrim, Stoneshard, and Dark Souls. The goal is to create a compelling, fun-to-play game that is Free and Open Source.

## Background

OWP2 is the successor to OWP. The original project was overly ambitious for an individual and constrained by certain tools, such as MapMagic. OWP2 addresses these issues without changing the end goal.

## Approach

- Framework: Built on [AnyRPG Core](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore) ([anymmo.org](https://www.anymmo.org/)), which provides a configurable RPG framework to drastically speed up development and improve quality.
- Terrain: Developing a custom terrain engine from scratch to avoid MapMagic limitations and gain more control over world generation. It will be free and open source and released as a separate, standalone repository once it is in a usable state.
- Engine: Since we're starting over anyways, we're switching to Unity 6 for it's improved URP pipeline and new tools.

This is an extremely complex and ambitious project, but these changes should make it more manageable and elevate what I as a solo-developer can achieve.
